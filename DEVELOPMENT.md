# **DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS**

1. I intially tried using OpenCV's Principal Component Analysis library to calculate the linear aggression, but unfortunately it didn't work as it uses vectors and is used more for complex image-based regressions.
2. Then I looked into shark library and tested it to see how it works on Xcode.
3. I also studied how to calculate regression myself and found and understood code that doesn't use any library to calculate the regression.
4. I also found the data set that I would be using for my project.
