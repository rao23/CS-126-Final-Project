# **Final Project**

## ***LIBRARY USED:***
1. I used the boost numerical library in my CSVReader class to split the string wherever the delimiter (which is a comma in this case) is present.
2. Also I used boost to calculate the probability density of the poisson distribution.


## ***ADDONS USED:***
1. I use ofxDatGui to create the dropdown menus and buttons in the window display.
2. I also use ofTrueTypeFont to print the result on the window display.
